## Welcome to the Local Space Station 

This is our second project with the GA Softwarre Engineering Immersive Program (SEI22-Flex-LDN). We had to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**. The API we chose was NASA's 

### Technical Requirements

Our app had to:

* **Consume a public API** 
* **Include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Include wireframes** - that we designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML**.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## About our app

* Local Space Station consumes **[NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day]()** **working application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
  * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * **general approach we took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application 
    * Link to our **[wireframe] (https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/027/401/original/wireframe-for_project-2.png?1645095611)**
   * **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use**.
* **Write DRY code**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.**
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
