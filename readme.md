## Overview

For our second project in the GA Software Engineering Immersive Program, we had to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**. We decided to build a calendar using  **[React-Calendar Library](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-calendar-tutorial-build-customize-calendar/)** that consumes **[NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API](https://api.nasa.gov/)**. Our calendar shows a thumbnail image of the NASA image for a given date on the calendar. Each date on the calendar links to the day's full image and explanation of the image. This explanation is also pulled from the API. 

### Technical aspects of our project  

Our app had to do the following:

* **Consume a public API** - we fetched our data from NASA's APOD API: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod
* **The app had to include a router** - our routes are housed in our App.js file.
* **Include a wireframe** - **[here it is](https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/027/401/original/wireframe-for_project-2.png?1645095611)**. 
* Demonstrate **semantically clean HTML** - we reread our code to make sure it read clearly.
* **Be deployed online** - you can have a look here! => **[Local Space Station](https://mystifying-goldberg-c06879.netlify.app/)**.
* **Extra's we added** - we imported the React-Calendar Library

## Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome
    During our project we had a couple of obstacles to overcome.
    Since we were using a library as well as an API - a calendar library and a NASA images API - we had to get those two to play nicely together. In the beginning, normal images would load on the calendar but the NASA API images wouldn't. We overcame this by adding a 'loading' image, which would show while the NASA image URLs were still downloading. This simple check ensured that as soon as the data was fetched, the images would show, as React would re-load the page. It also helped with our issue that the API load was slow. This is still an ongoing issue that to load the data for a whole month, as we do for the calendar page, takes a noticable time. Although we could not speed this up due to API limitations, our loading images minimise the impact.
    
    Another hurdle we faced was working together as a team. Since this is our first pair-coding exercise, we had to figure out how to split up the work. It took a lot more communication than we expected, because we found at times we'd be working on the same sections of code, or that there were only 2 things to work on at the time between 3 of us. We found a tactic which worked really well was splitting out the work between us, and agreeing to check in 30 minutes later for a quick update. One time this worked especially well, was when we were choosing which calendar API to use, and we investigated one of these each to report back. As for the lack of work issue, we found smaller tasks to do such as styling, and ensured that we mixed this up between people. We also swapped tasks when stuck on something, which helped to get fresh eyes on the code.
    
    Finally, a problem we didn't manage to solve was getting the 'back to calendar' button from any given date page to direct the user to the calendar month the date was from. Instead, it always directs to the real-life current month. This is something we ideated around, including changing the URL of the calendar to include the month shown, but essentially didn't have time to implement the complexity it required.

    One thing we would do differently next time is to write more pseudo-code at the beginning of the project. We feel this would help to structure our process more and ensure we're looking at problems from the same angle at the get-go. When working on a project alone, a lot of the pseudo-code can be in your head, but with other people it's much better to be clear about for example what data is passed from one component to another, especially when each working on those components separately. 
    
    We are also more comfortable with reading documentation and see the value in doing this before diving into a project using, for example, a library. When we were comparing the documentation for calendar libraries, there were vastly different functionalities between the offerings and it was important we used one flexible enough for our needs, but was also great that we used one small and specialised enough that we weren't installing gigantic files or firing complex commands for simple effects.

## Stretch Goals if we had more time 
* Implement functionality on the "Back to Calendar" button that takes the user from the page with the big image back to the month they were on in the calendar.
